# Knight's Tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square only once. 
If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately,
following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open. [source: Wikipedia]
